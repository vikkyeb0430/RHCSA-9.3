TIP#1

It is highly recommended to prioritize using a wired connection, such as Ethernet, or a reliable Wi-Fi network for your exam. While a mobile hotspot can be used, it is not considered reliable and may lead to network connectivity issues during your exam.

TIP#2

Begin by thoroughly reading all the important information, including VM details, passwords, and Podman login credentials. Next, review all the exam questions and prioritize those related to partitions and logical volumes. Addressing these tasks first allows you to revert any mistakes and start the exam from scratch if necessary. If errors occur with partitions towards the middle or end of the exam, there will be insufficient time to redo all tasks.

TIP#3

You will be providing two VM's, make sure to configure both vm in the starting as per the given task and then you can move towrds completion of all the questions one by one.

TIP#4
Always use an external terminal to access your VMs via SSH as root. Since the VMs may be slow, using an external terminal ensures better performance. Additionally, this approach facilitates copying and pasting commands from the question paper, which is not possible within the internal VM.

TIP#6

Develop a habit of verifying every step and change you make, ensuring the output is correct before proceeding to the next question. For example:

When adding a user, check the /etc/passwd file.
After making changes to fstab, reboot the machine and ensure the partition is mounted.
This practice will help you move on confidently without worrying about the correctness of previous tasks.
